It is a Deep Learning exam where we learnt the basics of Deep Learning:
"This course is designed to provide you with the theoretical foundations, methodological approaches and tools for the design, 
development, evaluation, optimisation and analysis of deep machine learning-based models, as well as for their presentation and responsible use to support 
the decision-making process and digital assets of modern organisations and companies, according to their mission, interests and needs. We are excited to accompany 
you on this exciting learning journey, preparing you to confidently face challenges and exploit opportunities in an increasingly dynamic world thanks to the development of artificial intelligence."

Our project goal is to create a model that can recognize speech, and we used the following dataset:
